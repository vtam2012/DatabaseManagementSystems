# Bird Strikes Database Construction from .csv and Analytical Report done from SQL queries
Built a database that can be used to analyze bird strikes on aircraft. For an existing data set from the FAA [1] saved as (BirdStrikesData.csv)
A logical data model and relational schema  was built see ( Practicum I_Bird Strikes - Data Model.pdf). The relational schema was then realized in MySQL/MariaDB. The data was loaded into the database from BirdStrikesData.csv and certain SQL queries were executed to perform some simple analysis of the data.
