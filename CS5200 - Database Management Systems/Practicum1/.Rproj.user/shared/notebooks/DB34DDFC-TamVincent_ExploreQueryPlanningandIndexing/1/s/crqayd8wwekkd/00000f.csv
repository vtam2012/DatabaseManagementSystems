"0","# Time elasped for select query on joining the three tables (film, film_actor, and film)  MySQL showed 0.238 to 0.252 seconds which is about 200 times as slow as SQLite. This shows that joins are an expensive operation in MySQL which is expected as it takes O(n^2) time to join two tables and another O(n^2) time to join the last table."
